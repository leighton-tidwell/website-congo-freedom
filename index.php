							<p>Along the equator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Congo Rainforest spans about 1.5 million square miles. <a id="seeMore" href="javascript:$('#reveal1').show(); $('#seeMore').hide(); void 0; turnIntervalOff();">See more...</a> <span id="reveal1" style="display:none;">  It's the world's second largest rainforest (only the Amazon is larger). The most famous Congo rainforest people are called Pygmies. Commercial logging and expansion of farming makes it one of most endangered ecosystems in the world.
            Five national parks in the Congo Rainforest are UN World Heritage Sites.  The Congo rain forest average rainfall is about 58 inches per year.  Average temperature is 77 degrees Fahrenheit. It is home to more than 11,000 different species of plants. In dense parts only 1% of the sunlight reaches the ground.  Cancer Institutes have identified approximately 1,400 rainforest plants which could potentially be used to fight cancer. We have only learned how to use 1% of these amazing plants, resulting in 25% of our modern medicines.  Imagine the possibilities from the other 99%.
            We depend on rain forest trees to absorb carbon dioxide we exhale, and to provide oxygen we need. When rainforest trees are burned they release carbon dioxide, which pollutes the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. Deforestation is one of the major drivers of climate change emitting carbon dioxide.  NASA satellite images shows the “browning” of the Congo rainforest likely due to the warming of the Atlantic Ocean.
            Without rainforests droughts would become more common and would lead to human catastrophe.  This rainforest is home to about 450 species of mammals, 300 reptile species, 200 amphibian species, and over 1,000 bird species.  The Congo rainforest is the only place in the world where all three subspecies of gorillas can be found. They are the mountain gorilla, lowland gorilla, and the eastern lowland gorilla.  Bonobos are found only in the Congo rainforest; they and chimpanzees are humans’ closest relatives – the former peaceful and the latter violent. <a id="seeMore" href="javascript:$('#reveal1').hide(); $('#seeMore').show();turnIntervalOn(); void 0;">See less...</a></span></p>

							<p>Virunga National Park in eastern DR Congo is the oldest park in Africa and a World Heritage site. <a id="seeMore2" href="javascript:$('#reveal2').show(); $('#seeMore2').hide(); void 0; turnIntervalOff();">See more...</a> <span id="reveal2" style="display:none;"> It is the home of most of the 880 endangered mountain gorillas (scientific name Gorilla beringei beringei) left on the planet and they are in danger of extinction due to conflict.  These gorillas live high up above the equatorial jungle lowlands in the Virunga mountains, whose summits are higher above them, such as the 14,787 foot Mt. Karisimbi.
        National parks are one example of the enormous potential for tourism dollars that could flow into DR Congo to benefit the people, if the areas were safe from violent conflict.  See the <a data-ajax="false" href="https://virunga.org/">national park website</a>.  The movie “Virunga” is Leonardo DiCaprio's academy awards Oscar nominee for a “documentary” about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  “Virunga” is about the Congo wars, the people living in the Virunga mountains of eastern Congo and about rare gorillas.  The word "virunga" is an English version of the Kinyarwanda word ibirunga, which means volcanoes. The dangerous volcanoes there are symbolic of the wars.  Watch <a data-ajax="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu-vjWd7Tb8">this</a> Virunga trailer.

With an elevation of 16,763 feet, Margherita Peak is the highest mountain straddling the border of the DR Congo and Uganda, and is the third highest in Africa, after Mount Kenya 17,057 feet and Kilimanjaro 19,341 feet.  Margherita was the wife of Italian Luigi Amedeo, Duke of Abruzzi, who climbed this mountain in 1906 at a time when King Leopold was still slaughtering Congolese in the Belgian Congo.  Margherita Peak is the highest permanent source of water for the Nile River. <a id="seeMore" href="javascript:$('#reveal3').hide(); $('#seeMore3').show();turnIntervalOn(); void 0;">See less...</a></span></p>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congo Freedom Alliance is an international pro-democracy think tank.  We study and advocate for good governance ideas in the DR Congo such as:  effective national and provincial constitutions with national supremacy over essential functions, separation of powers and checks and balances to prevent abuse of power, rule of law, truth, justice, freedoms, individual liberty, equality, human rights, and republic representative government in which supreme power resides among Congolese citizens who choose elected representatives based on honest fair elections absent of corruption.  Elected representatives and all other employees of government are responsible to the people and they govern only according to law and are tightly regulated by strong anti-corruption laws that can result in severe punishment.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congolese want a civilian government of, by and for all the people in the DR Congo, rather than rule by corrupt foreign and domestic civilian and military dictators benefiting only the few.  We think about how government can be inclusive of the many Congo voices, rather than the dictatorial personalities past and present who ignore and marginalize the will of the people.  We examine how successful countries have adopted more effective restraints to prevent abuse of power.  British Lord Acton said: “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” (<a data-ajax="false" href="https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-51">See Federalists Papers</a>)   Thomas Jefferson said: “In questions of powers, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”  Of a “good” Constitution.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of we Congolese is to achieve harmony by our government focusing on all issues contributing to our happiness, our safety, and our well-being, as encouraged by <a data-ajax="false" href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/309">UN General Assembly Resolution</a> 65/309 titled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development.” <sup>1</sup>  To achieve our goals, we Congolese have identified intermediate objectives as identified by <a data-ajax="false" href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111">OECD’s 11 topics</a> that are essential to human well-being in terms of “material living conditions” (housing, income, jobs) and “quality of life” (community, education, environment, governance, health, life satisfaction, safety and work-life balance).   Congolese want to know that governments and businesses are working together to provide the basic needs of the people.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congolese want to establish new government organizations to protect the people from internal and external threats so they no longer live in a perpetual state of fear.  Congolese want the development of civil and military government agencies where these public servants deliver essential services to all Congolese in a neutral fair efficient and effective manner absent of corruption, and so government is no longer the feared oppressors of the people, but instead they are servants of the people.  Government must be reconstructed so it not only can accomplish all the things people need government to do, but also to construct restraints in law that forces government to control itself.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congo Freedom Alliance welcomes any ideas that contribute to improving the lives of all Congolese - especially for our children, who are the future.  Congo Freedom Alliance is a 501 (C)(4) non-profit registered with the Texas Secretary of State – founded by University of Texas Congolese refugee students, who were victims of war, and their faculty advisor.  Congo Freedom Alliance represents hope for positive change, and has grown to include the voices of many influential Congolese war refugees around the world and their families and friends still in danger inside the DR Congo.
