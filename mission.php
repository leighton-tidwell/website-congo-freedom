                                        a chance against this rigged authoritarian system? Consider all prior corrupt
                                        fraudulent elections, even as recent as 2011, when even under international supervision
                                        the elections were condemned as rigged. What would be different in any future election?

                                        Note, Denmark is ranked the least corrupt and the USA ranked as among top 15 least corrupt. 
                                        The Congo can do much better. Also see <a data-ajax="false" href="http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf">http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/ConvCombatBribery_ENG.pdf</a> and

                                        deliver essential services to all Congolese in a neutral

                                        and so government is no longer the feared oppressors of the
                                        people, but instead they are servants of the people. Government
                                        must be reconstructed so it not only can accomplish all 
                                        the things people need government to do, but also to construct 
                                        restraints in law that forces government to control itself.

                                        market economy. Congolese want to know that governments 
                                        and businesses are working together to provide the basic 
                                        needs of the people. Congolese want to encourage new

                                        threats, so they no longer live in a perpetual state of fear.

                                    for 22 years from 1960 to 2017. 
                                    Today, 125 nations contribute to maintaining
                                    some 22,590 personnel in DR Congo. The United 
                                    Nations peacekeeping mission in the DR Congo
                                    is very expensive. The one year UN cost to June
                                    2017 in Congo is $1,235,723,100 billion US dollars. 
                                    The USA contributes 28.3626% of that amount; thus 
                                    the USA contributes $350,483,199.9606 million US
                                    dollars for just this one year.

                                    Thus the USA alone since the 1960s has contributed billions that if had not been needed, could have been used at home for USA problems. The DR Congo peacekeeping mission is the single largest contribution of UN resources anywhere in the world. Very costly. This adds up to a large amount of scarce financial and human resources over decades tied up there that could be used elsewhere, if solutions were found to the Congo problem. It is Congo Freedom Alliance’s purpose is to be part of the solution so the DRC is no longer a drain on African continent and world resources.

					<!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congo Freedom Alliance is an international pro-democracy think tank.  We study and advocate for good governance ideas in the DR Congo such as:  effective national and provincial constitutions with national supremacy over essential functions, separation of powers and checks and balances to prevent abuse of power, rule of law, truth, justice, freedoms, individual liberty, equality, human rights, and republic representative government in which supreme power resides among Congolese citizens who choose elected representatives based on honest fair elections absent of corruption.  Elected representatives and all other employees of government are responsible to the people and they govern only according to law and are tightly regulated by strong anti-corruption laws that can result in severe punishment.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congolese want a civilian government of, by and for all the people in the DR Congo, rather than rule by corrupt foreign and domestic civilian and military dictators benefiting only the few.  We think about how government can be inclusive of the many Congo voices, rather than the dictatorial personalities past and present who ignore and marginalize the will of the people.  We examine how successful countries have adopted more effective restraints to prevent abuse of power.  British Lord Acton said: “Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” (<a data-ajax="false" href="https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-51">See Federalists Papers</a>)   Thomas Jefferson said: “In questions of powers, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”  Of a “good” Constitution.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of we Congolese is to achieve harmony by our government focusing on all issues contributing to our happiness, our safety, and our well-being, as encouraged by <a data-ajax="false" href="http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/65/309">UN General Assembly Resolution</a> 65/309 titled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development.” <sup>1</sup>  To achieve our goals, we Congolese have identified intermediate objectives as identified by <a data-ajax="false" href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111">OECD’s 11 topics</a> that are essential to human well-being in terms of “material living conditions” (housing, income, jobs) and “quality of life” (community, education, environment, governance, health, life satisfaction, safety and work-life balance).   Congolese want to know that governments and businesses are working together to provide the basic needs of the people.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congolese want to establish new government organizations to protect the people from internal and external threats so they no longer live in a perpetual state of fear.  Congolese want the development of civil and military government agencies where these public servants deliver essential services to all Congolese in a neutral fair efficient and effective manner absent of corruption, and so government is no longer the feared oppressors of the people, but instead they are servants of the people.  Government must be reconstructed so it not only can accomplish all the things people need government to do, but also to construct restraints in law that forces government to control itself.
					<br /><hr>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congo Freedom Alliance welcomes any ideas that contribute to improving the lives of all Congolese - especially for our children, who are the future.  Congo Freedom Alliance is a 501 (C)(4) non-profit registered with the Texas Secretary of State – founded by University of Texas Congolese refugee students, who were victims of war, and their faculty advisor.  Congo Freedom Alliance represents hope for positive change, and has grown to include the voices of many influential Congolese war refugees around the world and their families and friends still in danger inside the DR Congo.
